> An SMS-based OC Transpo app for finding out when the next bus is coming -- without cellular data!

![Screenshot](docs/images/Transitr.png?raw=true)

Transitr is a small **React Native** app that makes use of OC Transpo's SMS service to find upcoming bus arrival times. 

It uses the SMS service instead of the normal data service that other apps use to enable those who don't have cellular data to still find bus arrival times -- albeit, in a cleaner interface than manually having to text the SMS service.

Currently, only Android APKs are available for download. You can find the latest released APK on the [releases page](https://github.com/DevinSit/transitr/releases).

## FAQ

Here are some questions I'm sure you'll be asking.

### Why isn't there an iOS version?

Because I don't own any Apple products and didn't want to buy/rent one to build the iOS version. 

However, since the project _is_ open source, I'd be more than happy to have someone port the native code and build the iOS version!

### Why isn't the Android version on the Play Store?

Because I'm cheap and didn't want to bother setting up an account. 

Don't worry; you can totally trust that the APKs on the [release page](https://github.com/DevinSit/transitr/releases) are safe!

### Why doesn't the app do X?

Because along with being cheap, I'm also quite lazy. As such, I built just enough features to satisfy my own needs for a bus tracking app.

## Contributing

As much as this is an app that I actively use, I'm not really looking for other contributors. The app was built to satisfy my own needs, so if it happens to also satisfy yours, then feel free to use it, tweak it, etc. 

If you do happen to want to make contributions, open up an issue or a PR and I'd be happy to talk or look it over.
